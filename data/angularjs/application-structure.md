## Follow the LIFT Principle

Providing a consistent structure that scales well, is modular, and makes it easy to find code quickly increases developer efficiency and productivity. You can achieve this by following the LIFT principle:

1. `L`ocate your code quickly
2. `I`dentify the code at a glance
3. Keep the `F`lattest structure you can
4. `T`ry to follow the `Don't Repeat Yourself` (DRY) pattern
