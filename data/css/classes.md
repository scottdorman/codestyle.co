- Keep classes lowercase and use dashes (not underscores or camelCase). Dashes serve as natural breaks in related class (e.g., `.btn` and `.btn-danger`).
- Avoid excessive and arbitrary shorthand notation. `.btn` is useful for *button*, but `.s` doesn't mean anything.
- Keep classes as short and succinct as possible.
- Use meaningful names; use structural or purposeful names over presentational.
- Prefix classes based on the closest parent or base class.
- Use `.js-*` classes to denote behavior (as opposed to style), but keep these classes out of your CSS.

It's also useful to apply many of these same rules when creating Sass and Less variable names.
