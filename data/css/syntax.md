- Use soft tabs with two spaces&mdash;they're the only way to guarantee code renders the same in any environment.
- When grouping selectors, keep individual selectors to a single line.
- Include one space before the opening brace of declaration blocks for legibility.
- Place closing braces of declaration blocks on a new line.
- Include one space after `:` for each declaration.
- Each declaration should appear on its own line for more accurate error reporting.
- End all declarations with a semi-colon. The last declaration's is optional, but your code is more error prone without it.
- Comma-separated property values should include a space after each comma (e.g., `box-shadow`).
- Don't include spaces after commas *within* `rgb()`, `rgba()`, `hsl()`, `hsla()`, or `rect()` values. This helps differentiate multiple color values (comma, no space) from multiple property values (comma with space).
- Don't prefix property values or color parameters with a leading zero (e.g., `.5` instead of `0.5` and `-.5px` instead of `-0.5px`).
- Lowercase all hex values, e.g., `#fff`. Lowercase letters are much easier to discern when scanning a document as they tend to have more unique shapes.
- Use shorthand hex values where available, e.g., `#fff` instead of `#ffffff`.
- Quote attribute values in selectors, e.g., `input[type="text"]`. They're only optional in some cases, and it's a good practice for consistency.
- Avoid specifying units for zero values, e.g., `margin: 0;` instead of `margin: 0px;`.
