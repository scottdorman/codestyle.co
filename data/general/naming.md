## Word Choice

- Choose easily readable identifier names. For example, `HorizonalAlignment` is more readable than `AlignmentHorizontal`.
- Favor readability over brevity. For example, `CanScrollHorizontally` is better than `ScrollableX`.
- Avoid underscores, hyphens, or any other non-alphanumeric characters.
- Avoid using Hungarian notation.
- Avoid using identifiers that conflict with keywords of widely used programming languages.

## Abbreviations and Acronyms

- Don't use abbreviations or contractions as part of identifier names.
- Don't use acronyms that aren't widely accepted, and even if they are, only when necessary.
