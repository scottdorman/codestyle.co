Set your editor to the following settings to avoid common code inconsistencies and dirty diffs:

- Use soft-tabs set to two spaces.
- Trim trailing white space on save.
- Set encoding to UTF-8.
- Add new line at end of files.

Consider documenting and applying these preferences to your project's `.editorconfig` file or your editor options.
